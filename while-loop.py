# # Writing pseudocode
# Before you run the Python script, write out the logic of the while loop in written (non-code) sentences. This technique is called pseudocoding.

# For example:

# If the user has not guessed the correct answer, enter the loop.

# Ask the user for a guess.

# Is the guess the correct number?

# If the correct guess, tell the user it was the correct guess and exit the loop.

# If the wrong guess, tell the user it was the wrong guess and continue the loop.
